# Creating Specialized Layers

> Specialized layers allow you to organize and extract unique types of features tailored to your project needs. For example, you can create layers for linear features (like roadway centerlines) or sign features.

{% step %}
### 1. Create Linear Feature Layer
For some linear features like roadway centerlines, you may want to indicate the paint color and paint pattern. Below is an example of a layer created for the solid white centerline feature.

{% endstep %}
{% step %}
### 2. Create Sign Feature Layer
For signs, create a feature type with the sign face. Below is a sample of the sign feature with subattributes including MUTCD codes, condition of the signs, and the associated sign assembly ID.

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Tips and Examples

> Use specialized layers to separate different feature types for easier management and QA/QC.

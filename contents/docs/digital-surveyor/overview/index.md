> Mach9's Digital Surveyor automates feature extraction from pre-processed datasets, then guides you through QA/QC and delivers final outputs ready for CAD or GIS workflows.

Mach9 is a feature extraction software similar to existing extraction tools in the marketplace. Data acquisition, calibration, and processing is completed before uploading to Digital Surveyor.

Once data is uploaded, you define an **attribute template** to encapsulate all desired features. After templates are set, trigger a **perception request** to generate an initial draft of extracted features. Finally, perform **QA/QC** before exporting your deliverable.

## Workflow Overview

1.  **Data Upload & Processing**
    Collect, calibrate, and process data externally, then upload your dataset to Digital Surveyor.
2.  **Attribute Templates**
    Create or select a template to specify which features will be extracted.
3.  **Perception Request**
    Trigger an automated extraction run to draft your features.
4.  **QA/QC Workflows**
    Review and refine extracted features before approval or deletion.
5.  **Export Deliverables**
    Export finalized features for use in CAD or GIS applications.
